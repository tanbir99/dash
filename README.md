# dash!
Are your phone's clock and ability to do mental math not cutting it? Me neither, but here's an extension to help anyway!

dash! is a Google Chrome extension created to make it easy to keep track of when your classes are. You can see what class you should be in currently, how much time you have left in a class, as well as when your next class is.

I created this extension because I think it can actually be helpful: now that classes are remote, the lines between leisure and work time are often blurred. Hopefully, you'll find that this extension makes everything a little easier.


## Installation
A few more features will be implemented soon, and so I have not created an easy-to-use CRX file for this extension (yet).

For now, you can clone the repository from GitHub to a location of your choice on your computer. (NOTE: Your browser must have Developer Mode enabled for this method to work. You can find a link at the bottom of this README for more information.)

Once you have successfully cloned the repository, open the Chrome menu, hover over "More Tools", and select "Extensions". Click "Load unpacked" and select the root folder of the local copy that you downloaded.


## Usage
After installation, be sure to pin the extension by selecting the puzzle icon on the upper right corner of the browser, then clicking on the pin icon next to the dash! name.

When you click on the d! icon, you should see a message that says: "Please Open Extension Settings to Configure". Click on the gear icon on the top right of the popup; this will take you to the extension's settings.

Configure your classes here. Select "Add Class" under each day that you have classes. Remember to click save!

Please note that the extension currently works if you enter your class times in chronological order. I will be implementing features soon to automatically sort class times and ensure class times are not overlapping.


## Contributing
Pull requests are extremely welcome. I apologize in advance if I take some time to respond, school has started again and I am also currently working on another project that I hope I can eventually integrate this extension into.

I would also love to hear any feedback or potential ideas that I can implement into the extension!
